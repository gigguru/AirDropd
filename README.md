## 📌 Overview

**AirDropd** is a Windows application that implements Apple’s **AirDrop** and **AirPlay** protocols, allowing your PC to communicate and interact seamlessly with Apple devices.

With AirDropd you can:
- 📤 Share files using AirDrop
- 📺 Stream your screen using AirPlay  
All operations work **locally** over your network, without cloud or third-party services.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔁 **AirDrop**: Send and receive files between Windows PCs and Apple devices  
- 🖥️ **AirPlay**: Stream your Windows screen to compatible Apple devices  
- 📡 **Device Discovery**: Automatically discovers Apple devices using **mDNS**  
- 🍏 **Native Integration**: Appears as a native Mac device on the network  
- 🎨 **Modern Interface**: Clean and responsive UI

---

## 💻 System Requirements

- 🧩 Windows 10 or later  
- 🌐 Network adapter with **multicast** support  
- 🔐 Run as administrator (required for mDNS service)

## 🧱 Building

### Download (recommended)

Pre-built portable **`AirDropd.exe`** is produced by GitHub Actions on every push to `main`:

1. Open [Actions → Build Windows](https://github.com/gigguru/AirDropd/actions/workflows/build-windows.yml)
2. Download the **AirDropd-windows-x86_64** artifact — it contains a single `AirDropd.exe` with no extra DLLs to ship.

Tag a release (`v0.1.0`, etc.) to attach the exe to a GitHub Release automatically.

### Build from source (Windows)

```bat
build.bat
```

Output: `target\release\AirDropd.exe` (portable, statically linked MSVC runtime).

### Build from source (Rust)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gigguru/AirDropd.git
cd AirDropd
cargo build --release --bin AirDropd
```

- 💾 **AirDrop Protocol**: Implements Apple’s protocol for peer-to-peer file transfer  
- 📡 **AirPlay Engine**: Handles screen capturing and streaming  
- 🧰 **UI**: Modern, responsive user interface (based on egui or custom UI)
